# School_District_Analysis
## The purpose of this analysis is to look at how scores for math and reading courses are affected by each school district.

# For the district summary there is a significant disparity between reading scores and math scores for each student. There is only one exception where a particular student failed both math and reading. Besides that, the rest of the students passed one subject, but failed the other.

## For the school summary, the percentage between reading and math scores differs by a minimum of 10%.
## For Thomas High School, math and reading scores are irrelevant and not affected unlike Huang High School.
### For the THS 9th graders, the percentage is unaffected since it is categorized as nan. However, the student received an F.
### The budget amount for THS is calculated to be over $1,000,000.
### The school size for THS has a medium student population.
### Since THS is a charter school, the average math and reading scores are approximately 83%.
## 1. Recalculate the formula so that NaN does not appear.
## 2. If NaN does appear, bold that word to symbolize that the column is not being calculuated.
## 3. Expand the data by including a column for science scores and replacing it with NaN.
## 4. I would also highlight the scores by implementing a color scales format, including the one for NaN. A color for scores below 60, above 60,70,80, and 90%.
